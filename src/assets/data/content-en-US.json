  "home-body": "Starlene is a talented programmer and certified game designer with an affinity for games and interactive software. She previously worked using PlayCanvas, JavaScript, and 8thWall to push the limits of Augmented Reality technology in the web space. Star has efficiently completed many successful AR projects, and is now looking to break into the games industry.\n\nVideo games have long been a source of entertainment and fascination for Starlene, and they were the driving force in her pursuit of a computer science degree. In college, she competed in several game jams, and even won awards for some of the projects she was on. Even while she was working in the XR field, she never lost the spark of inspiration that games provide. During her time at Trigger XR, she concepted, prototyped, and pitched two AR games to push the potential of the Web AR space.\n\nIn addition to her work ethic and the quality of her output, Starlene prides herself in being part of and working to improve her workplace's culture. This can be seen in the fact that she was elected Trigger's first DEI chair, as well as through the multiple after-work game events she hosted, streamed, and archived. Star believes that the best work environment is one where everyone is supported and given the chance to reach their potential. Whether through development support, advocacy, or simply participating in after-work events, she does her part to make that belief a reality.\n",
